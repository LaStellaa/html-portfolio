<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Levante and i am an italian web develper (still learning for now!). I have been living abroad for the last deacade, 
  spending 6 years in London and 4 years in Singapore working as a Operations Manager for an inrenational chain of restaurants.
</p>

<p>During my time in south East Asia i had the chance to travel extensively, both for work and leisure, and i fell in love with that part of the word. 
  Along the way i met amizing people and had the chance to work with many culturally diverse teams, and learn so many new and interesting things. </p>

<p>As of now, i travel the world with my partner while studying, we love exploring, trying new cusines and make new memories. We have recently spent 6 month in Mexico, 
  which is a fantastic country an di cannot reccomend it enough. Currently we are in the Canary Islands and we will fly to Italy soon. I am very grateful and happy for 
all the things that i get to experience and i am looking forward to officially become a web developer and make a living out of it!</p>
